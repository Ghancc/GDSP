<p>
Over this past few months I wasn't sure how to keep playing my favorite games (usually board games) with my friends like we do every weekend on our designated "Game Night". It was already unfortunate having to leave awesome memories and experiences behind once I left for college, going separate ways from my friend and my brother. Whenever we're all home together we barely have time to live the good old days; playing all our favorite games. Instead of being able to re-live how it was we usually only have time to reminisce in the nostalgia. The same situation will happen again once I graduate college with all of my friends. Once May has passed we may only get to meet up together once a year to hang out. Even then, I bet that practice won't last 2 years because we live so far away from each other.
</p>
<p>
My project aims to prevent that from happening. Instead, I would like to still be able to hang out with my friends and family as much as possible and the best way to do that is to keep on playing. Even after we all have jobs and busy schedules, I hope we can all still meet up online once a week to play our top favorite board games. By doing so we will have something to look forward to every week, keep in touch with people we've known for so long, have an escape from the real world along with its stress, and to keep our minds sharp by playing games with high skill, strategy, and replay value.
